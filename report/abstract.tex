This project is about the development of a mobile application which will help customers and developers to communicate requirements for a software project by providing a uniform communications platform and automated test generation.
The project was conducted using the development process called Essence, proposed by our supervisor Ivan Aaen.
The product is composed of a mobile application that the Product Owner uses to specify requirements in the form of User Interface components arranged in screens, composing the final software.
Each of these requirements can be generated into automated tests to verify if the developed software fulfills the requirements.
Each requirement added by the customer is translated into development issues on GitHub, a platform most developers are familiar with, to isolate the customer from GitHub itself, while still providing insights into the development progress from GitHub.
