\section{Initial process}
During the initial project work, the group used the working process called Essence as described in~\autoref{par:preProject}.
While working using this process, the group had a group room with individual work places, where each group member could have their own personal belonging and use it as a "home base".
Within the room, multiple whiteboards were available for creative writing and work.
During this period, the initial phases of the project was conducted, where many meetings could be conducted.

While working under these conditions, the group where able to conduct spontaneous meetings simply by turning around the chairs.
Within such a group room a lot of tacit knowledge could be shared explicitly by simply being physically located within the same room.
The use of whiteboards allowed for fast brainstorming and fast validation of new ideas could be shared and evaluated upon.

Within the group, all group members was comfortable with this working method and felt that their productivity was at a high state. 

Meanwhile, the balance between project work and courses, was fairly heavy on the courses, but still allowed time for project work.
Since some of the courses did directly transfer to the project.
