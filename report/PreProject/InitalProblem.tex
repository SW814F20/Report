\section{Initial Problem}
This section will conclude the pre-project, and we will find our \textbf{Initial Problem}, which is the problem we wish to solve.

To find the initial problem, we need to look at our Challenge, see section \ref{subsec:theChallenge}, our prioritized Ecology Interfaces, see section \ref{sec:ecology-interface} and our prioritized Leverage Points, see section \ref{sec:leverage}.

Using all of this, we come up with this initial problem:

\noindent\hrulefill\par

    \begin{minipage}[c]{0,8\textwidth}
        The communication between customers and developers are one of the most challenging aspects of the development process.
\end{minipage}} \\
