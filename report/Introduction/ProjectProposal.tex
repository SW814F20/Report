\section{Project Proposal}
Neurospace ApS \cite{Neurospace} is a software consultancy company that specialises in machine learning.
The company consists of three employees and have been operating since late 2018.
Neurospace plans to operate in different countries within the EU but their customers are primarily located in Denmark.

Neurospace’s current primary focus is to provide predictive maintenance solutions for manufacturing companies in order to increase uptime and reduce operational costs.
One of the issues that Neurospace experiences are their customers’ concerns  regarding the high upfront costs associated with a predictive maintenance system since Neurospace cannot guarantee the system’s success rate beforehand.
The manufacturing companies would therefore have to make a substantial investment in predictive maintenance equipment with the risk of the data analytics not providing accurate enough predictions for the system to be cost beneficial.
Neurospace’s project proposal, see \autoref{app:ProjectProposal}, was therefore to develop a solution which can demonstrate the possible savings a company may experience if they choose to implement a predictive maintenance strategy without having to make a substantial upfront investment.
