At the beginning of this semester project, we had a project proposal that we proposed to our supervisor.
The proposal was the starting point for the discussion for what the project should be about.
Through discussion with our supervisor, and the ramification of the Covid-19 pandemic this proposal was heavily altered into a project management focussed project.
All though we see value in the original project proposal, the focus of the project is more relevant to the world situation and in the future.
We would like to introduce our original project proposal such that the reader can hopefully understand the pivots in the course of the project.
