\section{Review of Sprint}\label{sec:review-sprint-anne}
This section will conclude the first sprint, and highlight how successful the sprint was.
Furthermore, in Essence, we need to review our configuration table, which can be seen in~\autoref{sec:first-configuration-table}.
This table can either be the same, meaning that we have not changed our view, or we can change it, to reflect new insights or discoveries.
The reason why is that we need to use the configuration table in the next sprint.

The goals for this sprint was:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create the first configuration table 
    \item Create login system in the application
    \item Create screen overview and functionalities
    \item Create an overview board
    \item Implement the needed functionalities in the database
\end{itemize}

In~\autoref{sec:first-configuration-table} we created the first configuration table, and therefore we have completed the first goal, namely, the \textit{Create the first configuration table}.

~\autoref{sec:sprint-one-application} highlights the process in creating the application, and how we have implemented the needed functionalities, such as the \textit{Login system, Screen overview, and the Overview Board}.

The last thing is to implement the needed functionalities in the database, which can be seen in~\autoref{sec:sprint-one-backend}.
Here we went over what features we needed to implement, and how we did it, and in the end, we completed the last goal, namely the \textit{Implement the needed functionalities in the database}.

The last thing to look at is the criteria in the configuration table.
For the resolution expectations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Is the problem still worth solving
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Yes it is
    \end{itemize}
    \item Does the proposed solution solve the problem
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We believe it does
    \end{itemize}
    \item Have we used the correct leverage points
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Yes we have
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For the architecture expectations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is the architecture feasible
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Yes it is
    \end{itemize}
    \item Is the product user-friendly
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We have not shown a group of users the interface, therefore we cannot say if the interface is user-friendly or not
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Lastly the propositions expectations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is the translation effective
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We have not yet made any translation as of now, we cannot answer this
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

All of these expectations are almost answered with a yes, so in terms of our configuration table, we are on track.
Furthermore, we have completed all of the goals that we have for this sprint, and therefore this sprint has been a success.

The last thing to do is, to review the configuration table.
We have made several changes to the configuration as we have gathered more information about how we should create one, but also as we have learned more about the domain.
We have made changes to the following cells:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Leverage
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Removed JavaScript Frameworks, because we are using Flutter to create the mobile application
    \end{itemize}
    \item Qualification
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Changed both the Qualifier and Rebuttal, to reflect the new point of view
    \end{itemize}
    \item Criteria for Architecture Expectations
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Added more expectations to the architecture, as we wanted to have a more modularized architecture in the code
    \end{itemize}
    \item Scenarios \& Features
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Added more scenarios and more features, because of new information about the features that should be in this solution
    \end{itemize}
    \item Value Propositions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Added more points to Value Propositions to reflect the changes made in Scenarios and Features
    \end{itemize}
    \item Criteria for Value Propositions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Added more criteria to reflect the new value propositions 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The revised configuration table can be seen in~\autoref{tab:bente-configuration-table}.
