This chapter will describe the first sprint in the development process.

The purpose of this sprint is to get started on the project, meaning that we need to create the first configuration table, as we follow the principles of Essence.
Furthermore, we need to set up the mobile application, so we can start developing the application, and because we need to get and post data in the application, we need a database and API.
All of this leads us to the following goals that we have for this sprint.
All of these goals are goals that we want to complete to say that this sprint has been good:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create the first configuration table 
    \item Create login system in the application
    \item Create screen overview and functionalities
    \item Create an overview board.
    \item Implement the needed functionalities that the application needs.
\end{itemize}.

In the following section, will we go into more details about these three goals that we have, and how we completed them.
