\subsection{Solution to The Challenge}

The Challenge that this project set out to solve was as described in~\autoref{subsec:theChallenge}:

\begin{quote}
    Improve the communication between customers and developers in an Agile Software Development Process.
\end{quote}

The solution developed during this project, which is described from~\autoref{cha:sprintOne} to~\autoref{cha:sprint_3}\todo{change to include sprint 4!} was supposed to improve the communication between customers and developers.
However during the project period, the world was hit by the Corona Virus and to verify that the developed solution actually solves this problem, the product should be tested on development teams and customers.

However, since the project team, was both acting as both costumer and developer, the team itself is a valid organization to validate the solution.
Since the project group was working using the Essence working process, which is an agile process, the group would easily be able to incorporate the tool within their own project work.
Since, such a tool, is rather essential for the project work, the tool would need to be within a certain level of completeness.
The expected outcome of this project is that of a Minimal Viable Product (MVP), meaning that only the most basic features would be within the product.

The product, it self, is rather easy for the project group to implement as a part of their further development for the project.
Currently not all screens within the application will be supported by the application, since they make use of element not yet supported by the testpiler.
