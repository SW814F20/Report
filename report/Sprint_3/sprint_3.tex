In this sprint, we did not make anything new on the project, because of an unforeseen assignment we had to do.
The assignment was estimated to take three workdays, but took way longer than that, but should also have been made after this project was handed in, which is why we did not plan for this assignment.
In our project group, we gave everybody three workdays to do the assignment, but after we found out that the assignment would take longer, we dedicated the whole sprint to this assignment.
This, in the end, meant that we will not get as far as we planned, but we will still have the MVP as planned, with all its features.
Furthermore, some of the advanced features that we wanted to implement, will just be an idea of how one could have done it, rather than an implementation of it.
