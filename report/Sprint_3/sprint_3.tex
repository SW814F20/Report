In this sprint, we did not make anything new, because of bad time estimation and time planning.
We had an unseen assignment which meant we had to go full time into that assignment, and because of that, we did not use any time or little time on this project.
If we had been better to estimate and plan our time, we could have done more than we did, but we did not.
This means that we will not get as far as we planned, but still have an MVP that shows the features we want it to have.
