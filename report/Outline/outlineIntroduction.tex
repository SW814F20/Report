In this chapter we will outline the idea for our software solution, meaning we will present how we envision the entire pipeline from application to compiled tests and everything in between.

This is not a "What we are going to build" description, rather it is our starting point idea - that may or may not change throughout the project.
Furthermore, there might be ambiguity in some of the descriptions and ideas that are not yet fully thought out.
But that is a non-issue since we with the help of an agile inspired development process and by utilizing ESSENCE, see~\autoref{par:preProject}, will allow our self to learn and adapt throughout the timespan of the project.
We might even end up with a project that bare little to no resemblance with the starting point that we are going to outline in this section.
