In order to determine if our application is easy to use and fulfills the requirements, we decided to perform usability testing of our application very early in the project.
However, due to the Covid-19 situation, we have been left with no options of performing usability testing in a safe environment and since we have not been able to perform the usability tests in a safe environment, we have been forced to not test the application.

Below is an example of a usability test, that should have been performed to test the usability and flow of the application. 
The test is intended to test most of the general flow in the application, and test if the app is easy to navigate. 

The test is also designed to not indicate where the different elements are located on the screen.
This ensures that the elements used in the test should be intuitive to find and interact with.
