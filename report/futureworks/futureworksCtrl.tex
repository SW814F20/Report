\chapter{Future Works}
In this chapter we will discuss what we believe should be the focus for any future work related to this project.
We have chosen to divide it into two different sections, product and academic.
In the product section, we will discuss what we think the product is missing for being ready for the industry.
In the academic section we will discuss what we believe would be beneficial to research regarding the proposed solution.
