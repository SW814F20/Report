\section{Review}
To conclude this sprint, and this project, we need to review our progress.
Both in terms of the goals we had, but also if our configuration table is up to date.

Looking at the goals we had for this sprint, we can conclude that we have completed all of them.
We have finished our MVP, with the needed functionalities it should have.

In terms of our configuration table, we believe that it is up to date, as we have not changed our focus, but rather, we believe that our solution is more needed than when we started this project, because of the Covid-19 crisis.
Because of this, we have no changes to the configuration table.
