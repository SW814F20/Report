\section{Review of Sprint}\label{sec:review-sprint-two}
To conclude this sprint, we need to review our progress.
We will follow the same process, which can be seen in~\autoref{sec:review-sprint-anne}.

The first goal we had was to develop on the screen functionalities.
We have made some progress, however, we have not made a functional screen editor, so this goal is not successful.
We began working on the module for tests, and in its current state, it works as we want, however, it is missing some advanced functionalities.
The last thing we wanted to focus on was to research the GitHub API so we can work on it in the next sprint.
This is accomplished as we have a good understanding of how to use it and what API's we need to use for our application to work.

In terms of our configuration table, we still believe we are on track, however, after some feedback we have concluded that some of the criteria are not good enough, meaning that we need to have some specific criteria and not just overall criteria as we have now.
Therefore we have revised the configuration table, and have made the following changes:


\begin{itemize}
    \item Architecture
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We have added a new module, namely the translator module, to generate tests
        \end{itemize}
    \item Elements \& Ecology
        \begin{itemize}
            \item After feedback, we have a better understanding of what elements we have in our problem domain
        \end{itemize}
    \item Criteria for Architecture Expectations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Added specific criterias
        \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

The revised configuration table can be seen in ???
